# Policy and Compliance

The information security policy framework of an organization outlines the *policies*, *standards*, *procedures*, and *guidelines* that the organization follows to achieve maximum **cyber resilency** (the ability to withstand or quickly recover from incidents that were meant to disrupt business operations). 

### Policy

Policies are mandatory, high-level statements that define a set of rules that all people must follow when handling an organizations information and technological assets.

Information security policies can include statements that:
- clearly designate the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) as head of cybersecurity operations
- explain the the role that cybersecurity plays in the organization
- state that all employees and contracts are required to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information and the systems that facilitate the transmission, storage, processing, collection, etc of this information.

All policies must be reviewed and approved by high-level executives such as the chief executive officer (CEO). Policies that are high-level and not detailed, allow the CISO to easily adapt to changes in the business and technology enviroments. Policies become hard to maintain when they are lengthy because long-term maintenance becomes a problem when these long documents need to be reviewed and updated. And being able to update the information security policy is crucial, specifically because policies are influenced by external compliance obligations that may also be quickly changing and thus being able to adapt to compliance changes is crucial for the safety of the organization.

Types of documents commonly defined in an information security policy framework:

- **Acceptable use policy** - describe how resources should be utilized
- **Data retention policy** - describe how data is being retained and how long
- **Data classification policy** - defines how the organization classifies data
- **Data ownership policy** - defines and provides information about the rightful owner of data
- **Continuous monitoring policy** - explains how an organization is monitoring its assets and informs employees that their activites are subject to being monitored
- **Account management policy** - describes the account life cycle
- **Code of conduct policy** - describes expected employee behavior
- **Password policy** - sets a requirement for the creation of secure passwords
- **information security policy** - high-level statements that designate high-level authority and provide guidance for an organizations cybersecurity program

### Standards

Standards describe how an organization will ensure that the information security policies are being followed. Standards are more technical than policies and change more often than policies as they do not require approval from high-level executives. However, like policies, standards are also mandatory. Standards may include documentation discussing things such as the configuration settings of an application or operating system in use or the security controls that have be implemented when dealing with sensitive information. Generally, these standards are chosen from industry wide standards that have been tried and tested. 

### Procedures

Procedures are detailed step-by-step processes that individuals and organizations must follow when responding to a particular situation or carrying out a particular task. This may include documents that state the process of responding to incidents, securely deploying application to production environments, how data should be destroyed, how information systems should be monitored, etc. 

Some commonly defined procedures in an organizations information security policy framework are:

- **Monitoring procedures** - how an organization will carry out security monitoring activities
- **Evidence production procedures** - how the organization will collect digital evidence when requested
- **Patching procedures** - describe the process of applying patches to applications and systems and how often they should be performed


### Guidelines

Guidelines, unlike policies, standards, and procedures, are not mandatory, but instead are only recommendations on how an individual or organization should perform a task, use a technology, or interpret a concept.
