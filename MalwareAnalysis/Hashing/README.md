# Malware Analysis: Hashing

Hashing is used in cybersecurity to obtain a unique fingerprint for a particular file and input data. In malware analysis, hashing is used to identity known malware files.
Older antivirus engines depended heavily on their ability to identify malware on a host simply by attempting idenity a malware's known signature, i.e. it's hash value.
Malware has become more advanced and has adopted polymorphic abilities that allows it to create thousands a sample of itself, never producing the same hash for a sample.
Due to this modern malware behavior, antivirus engines have also had to modernize their analysis techniques to identify malware on a compromised host. Antivirus engines now
use behavior analysis and heuristic analysis to attempt to identify novel or known malware on a host by analyzing a files behavior and discovering malicious intent.

### Tools

There are many tools that allow you to generate hashes. In malware analysis the most commonly used hashing algorithms are MD5, SHA1, and SHA256.
On **Linux**, you can find built-in tools that provide these hashing algorithms such `md5sum`, `sha1sum`, and `sha256sum`. On **Windows**, you can use PowerShell
to generate file hashes using the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet like this:

```powershell
# MD5
Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 somefile.txt

# SHA1
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 somefile.txt

# SHA256
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 somefile.txt
```
