# Malware Analysis: Windows Internals

### Win32 API

The Windows OS allows developers to invoke low-level API commonly referred to as the Win32 API. The Win32 APIs provide an interface to the
Windows OS for developers who wish to write software that'll run on the Windows OS. The Windows APIs are available for both 32-bit and 64-bit
Windows OS. Malware developed to run on a Windows OS will invoke a ton of Windows API functions so a malware analyst must be familiar with
the APIs commonly used by malware in order to distinguish malicious API usage from ordinary usage. This requires that a malware analyst
observes the context in which an API is being utilized in and not just that the API was used, otherwise, all applications running on a 
Windows OS would be considered malicious.
